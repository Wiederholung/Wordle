## Getting Started

This is a New York Times style Wordle game developed in Java.

- Guess the Wordle word in tries just one more than the word length you selected.
- Each guess must be a valid word with the length you selected.
- For each letter you confirm to enter, it will show:
  - Green if it is in the word and in the correct spot.
  - Yellow if it is in the word but in the wrong spot.
  - Grey if it is not in the word in any spot.

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder to maintain compiled output files

## Complie & Run
